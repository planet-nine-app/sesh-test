# Web 3

So if you're not familiar with Web 3, the tl;dr is the term refers to an effort to replace parts, or all of the internet with blockchain-based solutions. 
One of the motivating factors is to anonymize user data such that we're all not giving away our personal info to big tech companies. 
[I won't comment on the overall effort of Web 3](https://www.web3isgoinggreat.com), but this anonymization is definitely a goal of Sessionless. 
I just thought we should be able to do it without a blockchain if we wanted.
