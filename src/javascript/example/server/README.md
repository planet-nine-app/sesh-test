### Overview

This is a simple Express server for the Sessionless protocol. It defines the following endpoints:

`/register`: Registers a new user

`/do-cool-stuff`: Verifies a payload signature and returns a response. 

### Starting the server

running `npm i && node server.js` should start the server, assuming you've got node on your machine already.
